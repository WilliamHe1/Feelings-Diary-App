# Feelings-Diary-App

Our app “Feelings Diary” is an application that helps students with their mental health problems by using the principles of the Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) to help recommend to our users various activities on their phone to help them through their mental health problems. Our app is mainly concerned with students who are struggling with:
- an unstable sense of self
- intense emotions
- impulsive actions
- relationship difficulties
- black and white thinking

Our app also provides a place for our users to keep a diary for them to write out their feelings and experiences. In addition, Our “Let us know how you feel” quiz will help decide what activity our user should do based on how the user answers each question on the quiz on a scale of 1 to 5. Once the user finishes taking our test, the app can then direct the user to a relevant app that can be used to complete the activity our app suggests.

The app will suggest activities based on these scores (the 4 modules of DBT):

Emotional Regulation (ER) -> Direct user to write in their diary and reflect on their emotions.
Distress Tolerance (DT) -> Direct user to set a 20 minute timer to do meditation.
Interpersonal Effectiveness (IE) -> Direct user to contacts so the user can call a friend.
Mindfulness (M) -> Direct user to a mental health YouTube channel where they can learn more about Mental Health.

A total of 18 possible points are allotted to each module weight


Each of the 4 modules has its own counter, and the buttons of 1 to 5 on each question is
multiplied with the weights of the question. Looking at the example question “Do you like
ice cream?” If the user answers 4 out of 5, the 4 is multiplied with each of its weights of
(M - 2) (IE - 2) (DT- 1) (ER- 3) and added to each Module Counter, resulting in M with a
value of 8, IE with a value of 8, DT with a value of 4, and ER with a value of 12. The
counters are added with the addition of each answered question, and the resulting
values of the module counts should give indication of which module is most relevant to
the user. In the case of a tie, in addition to the module counters, we should also have a
Precedence Module Counter in which the Module Counter values for each question are
further multiplied with its precedence. For example, looking back at the example
question, the values of 8, 8, 4, and 12 are further multiplied by its precedence value of
(3). We then look at the lowest Precedence Module Counter to determine which module
to focus on.
